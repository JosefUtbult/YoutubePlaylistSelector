# Youtube Playlist Selector

[Project Website](https://josefutbult.github.io/YoutubePlaylistSelector/)

The _Youtube Playlist Selector_ is a tool for playing playlists from Youtube and
switch between them seamlessly. This tool is mainly made for switching backing
tracks for tabletop RPGs, to easily change the mood of the setting. This tool
can be used hoverer you want though.

This tool runs locally in your browser, and allows for playing public or
unlisted playlists from Youtube.
